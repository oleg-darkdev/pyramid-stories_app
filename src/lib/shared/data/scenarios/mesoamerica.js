				'Nurri represents one of the lesser-known but symbolically rich pyramid complexes in central Mexico, influenced by the architecture of ancient civilizations like the Olmec, Zapotec, and early Maya. Its step-pyramid form reflects traditional Mesoamerican ceremonial design.',
				'Constructed with stone platforms and ascending terraces, Nurri likely served as both a temple and a calendar-aligned observatory. The orientation of the structure suggests astronomical functions tied to solstices and agricultural cycles.',
				'Though not as massive as Teotihuacan or Chichen Itza, Nurri’s preserved carvings and altars reveal a deep connection to spiritual rituals, blood offerings, and the veneration of celestial deities.'

				"Shunantunich is an ancient Maya archaeological site located near the modern-day border of Guatemala and Belize. The name means 'Stone Woman' in Maya, and the site is famed for its towering pyramid known as 'El Castillo'.",
				'Standing at about 40 meters tall, El Castillo was both a ceremonial center and an elite residence. The pyramid is adorned with detailed friezes depicting gods, rulers, and cosmological symbols central to Maya belief systems.',
				'Shunantunich thrived during the Late Classic period (c. 600–890 AD), playing a key political and religious role in the region. Its elevated placement offers panoramic views of the surrounding jungle and river valleys.'

				'Tikal is one of the most powerful and iconic ancient Maya cities, located deep within the rainforests of northern Guatemala. At its peak during the Classic period (c. 200–900 AD), it was a thriving metropolis and ceremonial center.',
				'Tikal’s massive stepped pyramids, such as Temple I (Temple of the Great Jaguar) and Temple IV, reach heights exceeding 60 meters. These structures were used for royal burials, astronomical observations, and religious ceremonies.',
				"The city features complex plazas, palaces, and causeways, all built without metal tools or the wheel. Tikal's legacy lives on as a UNESCO World Heritage Site and a profound symbol of Maya ingenuity and cultural depth."
