				'Gunung Padang is a megalithic site located in West Java, Indonesia, often referred to as the largest and oldest pyramid-like structure in Southeast Asia. Built from volcanic rock columns, the site sits atop an extinct volcano and spans several terraces constructed with remarkable precision.',
				'While local legends have long associated the site with ancient civilizations, recent geological surveys suggest that the lower layers of Gunung Padang may date back as far as 20,000 years, challenging conventional views of early human development.',
				'The structure is believed to have been used for spiritual or ceremonial purposes, possibly by multiple cultures over thousands of years. With ongoing excavations revealing hidden chambers and layers beneath the surface, Gunung Padang continues to intrigue archaeologists and historians worldwide.'
