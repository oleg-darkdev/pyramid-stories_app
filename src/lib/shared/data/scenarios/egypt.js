				'The Pyramid of Khafre is the second-largest of the three famous pyramids on the Giza Plateau, built during Egypt’s Fourth Dynasty around 2570 BC. It is easily recognizable by the remnants of its original limestone casing still visible near the top.',
				'Khafre, the son of Pharaoh Khufu, commissioned this structure as his eternal resting place. The pyramid originally stood at 143.5 meters (now 136.4 meters) and features a complex including mortuary temples and the iconic Great Sphinx, which is believed to bear his likeness.',
				'Constructed from limestone and granite, the pyramid showcases the engineering prowess of ancient Egyptian builders. Despite being slightly smaller than Khufu’s, its elevated foundation gives it the illusion of being the tallest on the plateau.'

				'The Great Pyramid of Khufu, also known as the Pyramid of Cheops, is the largest and most famous of all Egyptian pyramids. Built during the Fourth Dynasty around 2580–2560 BC, it originally rose to a height of 146.6 meters and remains one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World.',
				"Constructed with over 2 million limestone blocks, the pyramid served as the tomb for Pharaoh Khufu. Its precise alignment with the cardinal points and complex internal structure, including the King's Chamber and Grand Gallery, continue to fascinate researchers today.",
				'The pyramid is a testament to the architectural genius of ancient Egypt, reflecting the civilization’s mastery of mathematics, astronomy, and logistics. It has stood for over 4,500 years as a symbol of royal power and religious significance.'
