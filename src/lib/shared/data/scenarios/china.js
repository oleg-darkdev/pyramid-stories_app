				'The Goguryeo pyramids in China are ancient burial mounds constructed for kings and nobility of the Goguryeo Kingdom, which once ruled parts of modern-day Northeast China and Korea. These massive tombs are believed to date back to the 3rd to 7th centuries AD.',
				'Built using stone and earth, the pyramids exhibit a stepped structure, similar in form to Mesoamerican pyramids, though distinctly East Asian in style and symbolism. Many are aligned according to geomantic principles (Feng Shui), reflecting the spiritual beliefs of the time.',
				"The most notable is the Tomb of General, often called the 'Eastern Pyramid', which stands about 11 meters high and covers an area of more than 3,300 square meters. These pyramids are a testament to the architectural and cultural sophistication of Goguryeo civilization."

				"The Canlin pyramids, located in the Shaanxi province near Xi'an, are large, ancient mausoleums attributed to early Chinese emperors and royal families, including those from the Western Han and earlier dynasties.",
				'Unlike Egyptian pyramids, these structures are flat-topped, earthen mounds often covered with vegetation, resembling natural hills. The most famous among them is the Maoling Mausoleum, the burial site of Emperor Wu of Han, one of Chinaâ€™s most influential rulers.',
				'These burial mounds are often accompanied by satellite tombs, ceremonial avenues, and spirit stones. Though less globally known than their Egyptian counterparts, Chinese pyramids like those at Canlin offer invaluable insight into ancient Chinese cosmology, ritual, and imperial power.'
