				'Unlike Egyptian pyramids, those at Meroe are narrower, steeper, and often feature small chapels at their base adorned with bas-reliefs depicting the life of the deceased and their relationship with the gods.',
				'The Meroitic civilization blended indigenous African and Egyptian influences, and the pyramids served as tombs for kings, queens, and nobles. Rich burial goods found in the chambers reflect the power and wealth of the Kushite rulers.'

				'Nuri is an ancient necropolis in northern Sudan, notable for containing the earliest pyramids built by the Kushite rulers of the Napatan period. The site includes around 20 pyramids and served as a royal burial ground from the 7th to 4th centuries BC.',
				'The most prominent pyramid at Nuri belongs to Pharaoh Taharqa, a powerful ruler who once controlled both Kush and Egypt during the 25th Dynasty. His pyramid is one of the largest in the region and symbolizes the blending of Nubian and Egyptian traditions.',
				'Although many pyramids at Nuri are now partially ruined, they remain a powerful testament to the legacy of the Black Pharaohs and their role in shaping the political and cultural history of the Nile Valley.'
