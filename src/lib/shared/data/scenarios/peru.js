				'Túcume is a vast archaeological site in northern Peru, home to one of the largest concentrations of pyramidal structures in South America. Built primarily by the Lambayeque and later the Chimú civilizations, the site includes over 26 adobe pyramids dating from around 1000 to 1470 AD.',
				'These flat-topped, terraced pyramids were constructed using sun-dried mud bricks and served as ceremonial and administrative centers. The largest of them, Huaca Larga, stretches over 700 meters in length, making it one of the longest pyramidal structures in the world.',
				"Túcume was deeply spiritual, with evidence of ritual offerings, elite burials, and murals indicating its use as a sacred landscape. Today, it stands as a powerful reminder of the pre-Incan cultures that shaped Peru's coastal valleys."
